# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Completed Items

### 1. Notification System (通知機能)

A comprehensive multi-channel notification framework that provides:

- **Channel Abstraction**: Unified interface for different notification providers
- **Built-in Channels**: Email, Slack, Discord, and Webhooks
- **Template System**: Reusable message templates with variable substitution
- **Routing Rules**: Smart routing based on notification properties
- **Reliability**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent notification flooding
- **Aggregation**: Batch similar notifications
- **Async Delivery**: Non-blocking notification sending

### 2. Monitoring System (モニタリング)

A complete monitoring solution that includes:

- **Health Checks**: Define and execute component health verification
  - Async execution with timeout support
  - Multiple status levels (Healthy, Unhealthy, Degraded, Unknown)
  - Metadata and context support

- **Resource Monitoring**: Track system resources
  - CPU, Memory, Disk, Network monitoring
  - Custom resource types
  - Configurable collection intervals
  - Threshold-based monitoring

- **Alert Management**: Rule-based alerting system
  - Severity levels (Info, Warning, Critical)
  - Complex conditions with operators
  - Duration-based conditions
  - Alert notification integration

- **Application State**: Track and monitor application state
  - State change tracking
  - Historical state queries
  - State persistence

- **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time monitoring data
  - JSON format for easy integration
  - Summary and detailed views
  - Export for external dashboards

- **Custom Metrics**: Business-specific metrics
  - Counter, Gauge, and Histogram types
  - Metric aggregation
  - Query interface

- **Lifecycle Hooks**: React to monitoring events
  - Start/Stop callbacks
  - Health check completion
  - Alert triggered events

## Technical Achievements

1. **GC-Safe Implementation**: All callbacks and async operations are GC-safe
2. **Thread-Safe Operations**: Proper synchronization for concurrent access
3. **Async/Await Pattern**: Non-blocking operations throughout
4. **Design Patterns**: Observer, Strategy, Factory patterns used appropriately
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage with edge cases
6. **Documentation**: Complete API docs with practical examples
7. **Integration**: Seamless integration between modules

## Next Phase

Phase 2 is now complete. The next priorities from Phase 2 are:

1. **Caching Layer (キャッシング層)**
   - Generic cache interface
   - TTL management
   - LRU/LFU strategies
   - Distributed cache support
   - Cache statistics

2. **Configuration Management Extensions (設定管理の拡張機能)**
   - Configuration validation
   - Dynamic reload
   - Configuration encryption
   - Environment-specific configs

The notification and monitoring systems provide a solid foundation for production-ready applications, offering comprehensive observability and communication capabilities.
